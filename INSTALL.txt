INSTALL.txt

How to install this unpackaged extension:

1. Place the folder somewhere on your system where it won't get in your way. 
2. Open Chrome and go to: chrome://extensions/
3. At the top of the page there is a button on the upper left that reads: "Load Unpackaged Extensions...". Click it and a file picker will come down. IF YOU DON'T see those buttons - there is a small checkbox in the upper right that says "Developer Mode", click it and the button should appear. 
4. Navigate to where you placed the folder earlier and select the folder itself and click "Select"

The BetterSpent extension should appear in the list of the extensions below and the orange icon should appear in your top bar to the right.
